Covers the backend and frontend for Sanrakshak
I with my team built a women safety device SANRAKSHAK .

Here is a link to pdf with the problem statement and solution proposed. 

https:bit.ly/sanrakshakprojectI would start with highlighting the fact that all the devices available in the market for women safety sends emergency call only after triggering it with some button or voice command. This solution doesn't cover 90% of the cases where in the victim doesn't even have time to react.

Our technical solution was to make this autonomous .

After a lot of brain storming  we could come up with a solution that was able to leverage the enormous amount of heart rate and temperature data generated every second to solve this problem.
